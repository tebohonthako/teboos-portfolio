          Hi, I'm Teboho Nthako üíØ, a passionate self-taught developer who
          transitioned into the tech industry nearly two years ago from a
          background in biological sciences, specifically genetics. 
          My curiosity for how online applications work, especially driven by my love for
          online shopping, sparked my journey into coding. I‚Äôm now a full-stack
          developer and had the opportunity to work as a coding mentor for
          bootcamp students and a junior developer in a small team for 9 months
          at a startup. I developed a deep love for front-end development,
          particularly React ‚ù§Ô∏è. <br />
          I also successfully completed a Systems
          Development NQF 5 Learnership with Absa and Shaper, where I gained
          experience working with technologies like Angular, TypeScript, Spring
          Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, Git, Docker, AWS, and Figma. Today, I share my
          journey as a tech content creator on TikTok, helping others navigate
          their way into the tech world just like I did. I‚Äôm passionate about inspiring
          the next wave of developers to make their own transitions into tech.
